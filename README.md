A Go-powered backend service for the Sync social media platform - built for performance, scalability, and developer friendliness. Handles authentication, content management, social interactions, and user data with robust security measures.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started quickly, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dracula-101/sync-backend
  cd sync-backend
  ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  ```

3. **Set up your environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root based on the provided `.env.example`:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

4. **Configure the env secrets:**
Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration, including database connections, JWT secrets, and Redis settings. Kindly refer to the [env setup](docs/ENV-SETUP.md) for details on required variables.
  ```bash
  # Example .env content
  HOST=localhost
  PORT=8080
  ENV=development
  LOG_LEVEL=info
  ```

5. **Run the application:**
  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

> [!TIP]
>  Import the postman collection from `/postman` to test the API endpoints or use the test the API using the Postman collection [Link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19532712/2sB2qdeymS)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic organized by domain
- **Clean Architecture** - Separation between controllers, services, and models
- **Modular Components** - Controllers, Services, Models, and DTOs
- **Data Storage** - MongoDB (documents), Redis (caching), PostgreSQL (geo)
- **Networking** - Gin framework, custom middleware, request validation
- **Authentication** - JWT tokens with multi-device session management
